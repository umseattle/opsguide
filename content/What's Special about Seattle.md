Title:  What's Special about Seattle?

Body:

It's important to note some special attributes of our Seattle club, compared to other alumni clubs around the country. 

* We are categorized as a Tier One Club by the AAUM.

* We are about as far from Ann Arbor as you can get in the continental US, so it is relatively difficult for us to get speakers from campus to come out to the area.

* Since Seattle is somewhat smaller, as well as cooler and wetter, than many other West Coast cities, this also makes it harder to entice potential speakers to visit our part of the country. 

* On the other hand, Seattle is a popular place to live and to visit, and has a very dynamic and prosperous economy. 

* Seattle's U-M alumni population is fairly large and growing relatively quickly, compared to some older and smaller cities.
