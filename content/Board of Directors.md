Index:  Board of Directors; 

Body:

All of our local club operations are staffed by volunteers. The club is run by a Board of Directors, and this is a working board, as well as a governing body. 

Board members communicate regularly with each other during the month via email, especially about any emergent issues that would be better handled without waiting for our next meeting. The special email address [board@umseattle.org](mailto:board@umseattle.org) can be used to send an email to all current board members. 

Note that Board Members are required to be active members of the AAUM. 

As stated in the Club Bylaws:

> The role of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Club.
>

> + (c) assisting the Club’s officers in the administration of the Club and in volunteer identification and recruitment;
