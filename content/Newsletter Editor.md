Title:  Newsletter Editor

Seq:    8.3.1

Level:  4

Body:

The responsibilities of the newsletter editor are to prepare and publish an email newsletter for our Club. 

Our email newsletter is the most popular form of communication for our members, based on surveys done in the past, and on continuing anecdotal evidence. 

Our emails go out to over 5,000 U-M friends and alumni, and a typical newsletter has over 1,000 unique opens. 

Note that we start to advertise most events at least a month before they will occur, and that as a result most events appear in multiple newsletter editions.

We use the Alumni Association Listserv to send out our email newsletters.
