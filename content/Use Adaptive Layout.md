When laying out the newsletter, make sure that everything looks good and is readable in varying conditions:

+ Variable screen width, so it looks good on a mobile phone as well as a desktop computer. 
+ Either light or dark backgrounds: many users today set their devices to employ a dark appearance, with white or very light text. Make sure the newsletter looks good with both light and dark device appearance settings.
