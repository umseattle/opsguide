Title:  Other Student Recruiting Activities

Again, Michael Tarlowe recounts some of his thoughts and experiences:

> Time permitting, I would also sometimes request a full roster in mid-April and reach out via email to any kids who have been accepted but not yet enrolled, from schools where we don't have an ASR who adopted it. I believe we have all schools deemed "priority" by Ann Arbor adopted by an ASR, but there are always admitted students from schools not listed, so if time allows, it is nice to reach out to those kids, like the ASRs do for adopted schools. 
>
> Because the Admissions Office rarely sends out a counselor to visit the local high schools, ideally, we'd have alumni do these visits. It can be tough since they are during the day, but this is an area of opportunity that I wasn't able to pursue as aggressively as I would have liked.
>
> One year, we convinced the Admissions Office to send out a counselor and we organized a breakfast which we invited all of the local high school career counselors to. Pauline helped me put this together. I thought it went very well, as we had a good turnout and the counselors were very engaged, asking lots of questions. It might be worthwhile to have this on your radar at some point in the next year or two.
