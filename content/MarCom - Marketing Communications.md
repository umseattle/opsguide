Title:  MarCom - Marketing Communications

AKA:    MarCom

Seq:    8.3

Level:  3

Body:

The primary function of Marketing Communications (abbreviated "MarCom") is to communicate our activities to local U-M alumni and to encourage their participation in these activities. 

MarCom is an essential function for our club. Successful communication can make the difference between a well-attended event much appreciated by members, and an expensive failure that no one attends. 

Our club communications also project an image for our club.

Our club communications also help to make our local alums feel connected to each other and to the local club, even for alums who attend few if any events. 

Club officers have frequently observed that our alums appreciate feeling "in the know" as part of a large and active local U-M community -- even if they rarely attend any of our events. What this means is that our club communications do more than market our events -- they are actually deemed valuable in and of themselves.
