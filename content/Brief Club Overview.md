Body:

This page is meant to be used by a board member when meeting with a prospective board member, to give them a brief overview of club operations. 

This should generally follow some brief exchange of introductions, including U-M stories. 

These are meant to be used as notes, not to be read verbatim by either current or prospective board members. 

+ Club Status

+ Nature of the Board
	- The club is run by an all-volunteer board of directors, aided by some subcommittees.
