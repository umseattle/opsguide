The Alumni Student Recruitment (ASR) program is a partnership between the Alumni Association and the University. 

See the [Alumni Student Recruitment](https://alumni.umich.edu/volunteer/alumni-student-recruitment/) page on the AAUM site for more info. 

Here's an example of a response from an actual student who had talked to an ASR rep:

> I wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk with me about the University of Michigan.
> 
> I enjoyed talking with you about your experiences on campus. It was clear to me that your passions for the Maize and Blue still run deep. After our conversation, as I drove home, I reflected on our discussion and really admire the excitement and dedication you have for your alma mater.
>
> Further, after our discussion, it reinforced to me that the University of Michigan was the school for me. 
>
> When I read your email saying that you had checked in with Admissions and gave me a name (Delphine) to contact in order to ensure the school understood that Michigan was my top-choice school, I jumped at the chance. 
>
> I wrote her a mail this evening, and plan on following up to ensure that the school realizes how badly I want to be a Wolverine.
>
> Thank you for the time you spent with me, for the motivation you gave me, and for the contact you provided me with. I greatly appreciate each of them, and am hoping to see you soon as a confirmed University of Michigan admitted student.
>
> Go Blue!

Couldn't make up stuff like this if we tried!
