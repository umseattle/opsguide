Title:  Management of Web Domain Names (VAR)

AKA:    Management of Web Domain Names

Seq:    10.5.5

Level:  4

Body:

The club currently owns two domain names:

+ umseattle.org 
+ umseattle.com

The domain names should redirect to our primary page on the AAUM site. 

Email addresses using these domain names may also be maintained in order to ease email communication, primarily by forwarding function names to one or more individuals currently assigned to perform those functions.

###### Domain Name Registrar

Our domain name registrar is [hover](https://hover.com). Our club has its own account there, with a User ID of umseattle. 

We need to renew our domain names on an annual basis. 

###### Shared Web Hosting

In order to easily do all this, someone on the board needs to have a shared web hosting account that we can use. 

We are currently using Herb's account, and he uses [A2 Hosting](https://www.a2hosting.com/).
