Title:  Club Membership

Seq:    5

Level:  2

Index:  membership; 

Body:

All current members of AAUM in the Club's geographic area (as determined by AAUM) are automatically members of the Club. The Club does not charge membership dues exclusive of AAUM. 

In general, our club's region extends to a 50-mile radius around the city of Seattle. 

U-M alumni, U-M students and their parents, and other supporters of U-M who are not AAUM members are welcome and encouraged to participate in most club activities, though they are not entitled to vote on club business or to serve on the Board of Directors.

The Club's primary funding is based on membership levels, as well as our performance, as judged by the AAUM.  

Part of the role of our Club is to encourage AAUM membership while still remaining open and welcoming to all U-M alumni and friends. We must always remember that people participate in our club in order to connect with other U-M alums, whether or not they are members of the Alumni Association.

All local alumni and other interested parties are [encouraged to join the Alumni Association](https://alumni.umich.edu/membership/join/), if they are not already members.
