Body:

Note that some of the responsibilities assigned to the various officers of the board within this document are fixed, while others are variable (VAR), and may shift from one officer to another, in any fashion that is agreeable to the Board. Responsibilities are assumed to be fixed unless otherwise specified. All necessary responsibilities should always be assigned to one officer or another, though, to assure accountability. Officers are empowered and encouraged to delegate responsibilities to other available Directors, either singly, or as teams, or as committees, and to name committee chairs, as needed.
