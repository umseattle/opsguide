<p>All of our local club operations are staffed by volunteers. The club is run by a Board of Directors, and this is a working board, as well as a governing body. </p>

<p>Board members communicate regularly with each other during the month via email, especially about any emergent issues that would be better handled without waiting for our next meeting. The special email address <a href="mailto:board@umseattle.org" class="wiki-link">board@umseattle.org</a> can be used to send an email to all current board members. </p>

<p>Note that Board Members are required to be active members of the AAUM. </p>

<p>As stated in the Club Bylaws: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The role of the Board is to manage the affairs of the Club. </p>

<p>The general responsibilities of directors include: </p>
<ul>
<li>(a) serving as liaisons among the Club’s leadership, its members, U-M alumni, current and prospective U-M students, AAUM, U-M, and the community at large; </li>
<li>(b) representing the diverse interests of the general membership; </li>
<li>(c) assisting the Club’s officers in the administration of the Club and in volunteer identification and recruitment; </li>
<li>(d) attending a majority of Board meetings in a given year; </li>
<li>(e) attending Club events on a regular basis; and </li>
<li>(f) contributing significantly to the work needed to sustain and improve the Club. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Our <a href="https://alumni.umich.edu/communities-clubs/u-m-club-of-seattle-about/seattle-club-leadership/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">club website</a> should list the current members of the club&#8217;s board. </p>

<p>The AAUM also maintains a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W1iiaZL0zLpEAcEvROH08oudEKs5Bn9oW4vAy9swKNM/edit?usp=drivesdk" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Sheet</a> containing a current list of our board members. </p>
