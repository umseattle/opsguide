energy to make sure each event is a success Following are the steps needed to plan and organize a successful club event 1 Define Event Purpose and Intended Audience Try to be clear minded about why U M alums might want to attend and what sort of U M alums would be interested 2 Select Date for Event This should generally be 60 90 days in the future for more complicated events and 30 60 days in the future for simpler events to allow adequate time for planning coordination and communication Select a date and time that doesn t conflict with other club events and doesn t conflict with other major events in the area Also consider seasonal factors Plan outdoors events when the weather is likely to be good and indoors events when the weather is likely to be less welcoming 3 Select Venue for Event You may wish to consider some of the following questions when selecting a venue Is it centrally located Is there a space where families with children can be seated Is parking available How expensive is it Is it easily accessible via public transit Is the event area private and free of distractions Can the space accommodate the desired number of participants Does the establishment have access to the Big Ten Network BTN Is there space for a registration table if one is needed What are the costs of food and beverage Is there audio visual equipment available if such equipment is needed What are costs considering food and drink etc Are there any minimums Are they per event or per hour Are there any additional taxes tips or fees that will be added on to the basic costs 4 Consider a Sponsor for the Event Although a sponsor is optional a local business may be willing to help defray some of the event costs in return for an opportunity to market itself to your participants See the AAUM Sponsorship Guidelines on the Club Leader s Site before selecting a sponsor 5 Estimate Income and Expenses for the Event Consider expenses such as facilities costs food beverages etc Consider income such as registration fees and possible sponsoring host Consider possible discounts for AAUM members and the amount needed to subsidize these discounts You may use the attached Budget Template to complete and total your estimates 6 Submit Event Proposal Your proposal should include all or most of the following information You may prepare your proposal by creating a new Event in the Planning Stage on our Website or by simply including this information in an email that you send to the board When Enter proposed date and time of the event What Enter a brief descriptive title for the event Where Enter the location of the event including the name and address of the venue Who Identify who is assigned to plan coordinate and host the event including contact info Why Enter the purpose of the event and why the club should hold it Teaser Enter two or three sentences describing the event Blurb Enter one or more paragraphs with additional details other than When and Where and Who Cost Enter the cost per person to attend the event including member and non member pricing Planned Income How much money will we receive for registration fees etc Planned Expense How much money will we need to spend Planned Attendance Enter the number of expected attendees Discussion points Highlight any questions or issues that merit further discussion by the board 7 Obtain Approval for Event The board should approve all club events before beginning any communications to members or any financial commitments by the club The first step in holding a successful event is picking an event worth holding None of the following guidelines are absolutes but all are worth considering before deciding to hold an event Positive Factors for an Event Here are some factors that bode well for a prospective event 1 A definite Michigan connection We sometimes host events that have no particular Michigan connection but those that feature a person or thing related to Michigan are particularly attractive to our members 2 Events that provide an opportunity for alums to meet and interact with each other 3 Events that one or more board members wish to attend 4 Events with some element of novelty something different that we haven t done before or haven t done recently 5 Repetition of a similar past event that proved to be successful perhaps with some interesting variation Negative Factors On the other hand here are some things to watch out for 1 Events that put the club at some significant financial risk In other words if we have to front money for an event and become dependent on having a certain number of alums attend in order to recoup our expenses then this is less attractive than events where participants pay as they go without any obligation on the club s part to have some minimum number of alums attend 2 Events without committed board attendance If board members are all supportive of having an event but no one on the board is actually excited enough about the event to actually attend then this is generally a pretty good indication that turnout will be low Other Considerations 1 It takes considerable time and effort to promote an event so even if an event can be held for free we may not want to invest the time to advertise it if it is likely to have little benefit for alums 2 If we promote events that draw few attendees then those that do show up may form a negative impression about our events and may be discouraged from attending other events that we hold 3 If we advertise events that are not attended by any board members then attendees may feel that we have broken faith with them by asking them to attend an event that we ourselves do not feel is worth attending 4 If we advertise events that are not attended by any board members then we do not have any control over the quality of the experience and we do not have a chance to obtain any direct feedback about the quality of the experience 8 Submit to AAUM Submit the event to AAUM for posting on our website using this form https umich qualtrics com jfe form SV 3jTSmCRrpscajml 9 Begin Promoting Event to Local Alums Send information to the MarCom team Send a Save the Date note through the club listserv May also wish to recruit additional volunteers through the club listserv 10 Recruit Speakers or Mentors if Needed Obtain biographies to be used in event promotion 11 Sign Contract for Venue Nail down date and facility costs Identify any food and drink to be paid for by the club Submit contract or firm email commitment to club treasurer and president for final review and approval 12 Continue Event Promotion Send additional information to the Marketing Communications team Communicate event details Start registration of attendees 13 Prepare for Event Confirm event agenda and facilitator speaking points Assign volunteer roles for day of event Gather event resources such as signs name tags pens table cloth etc Plan for final food and beverage quantities based on registration numbers Print AAUM career and club resources to market membership and programs If the event involves any degree of physical risk then print enough Participant Waiver of Responsibility Liability Release Forms so that all attendees can sign them 14 Register Attendees Have attendees sign the Participant Waiver Liability Release Forms if there is any degree of physical risk associated with the event 15 Complete Event Evaluation For all events complete an event recap 16 Send Receipts and Income to Club Treasurer The treasurer can make deposits record all financial transactions associated with the event and retain copies of all paperwork 17 Review Event Outcomes with Board Discuss the event at the next board meeting in order to share lessons learned"
