<p>The Admissions Office recommends holding these in late March or early April. Key is to try to avoid spring breaks at key high schools that would dampen attendance. A few weeks before the event, we would request a full roster for the state of WA of all admitted students. We would then send email invitations to all admitted students in the area, and also ask all local ASR reps to follow up with personal emails to admitted students at their schools. </p>

<p>Michael Tarlowe, our long-time coordinator in this area, says: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the things I enjoyed the most about this part was offering students the opportunity to connect with a current UM student from our area if they were planning to visit campus. Many students took me up on this and provided feedback that it was very helpful. So, I&#8217;d recommend keeping up this tradition both for students that attend the event, as well as ones that seem interested but cannot make it. Of course, it does mean you will have to maintain a short list of what I referred to as Ambassadors, current UM students from our area, that are willing to meet with kids. </p>
