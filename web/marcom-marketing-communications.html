<p>The primary function of Marketing Communications (abbreviated &#8220;MarCom&#8221;) is to communicate our activities to local U-M alumni and to encourage their participation in these activities. </p>

<p>MarCom is an essential function for our club. Successful communication can make the difference between a well-attended event much appreciated by members, and an expensive failure that no one attends. </p>

<p>Our club communications also project an image for our club. </p>

<p>Our club communications also help to make our local alums feel connected to each other and to the local club, even for alums who attend few if any events. </p>

<p>Club officers have frequently observed that our alums appreciate feeling &#8220;in the know&#8221; as part of a large and active local U-M community &#8211; even if they rarely attend any of our events. What this means is that our club communications do more than market our events &#8211; they are actually deemed valuable in and of themselves. </p>

<p>The email address of <a href="mailto:marcom@umseattle.org" class="wiki-link">marcom@umseattle.org</a> should forward to all current members of the MarCom team. </p>

<p>Members of the MarCom team are encouraged and authorized to edit any submitted content in order to meet their goals and guidelines. </p>
