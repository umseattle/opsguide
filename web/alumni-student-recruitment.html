<p>The Alumni Student Recruitment (ASR) program is a partnership between the Alumni Association and the University. </p>

<p>See the <a href="https://alumni.umich.edu/volunteer/alumni-student-recruitment/" class="ext-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alumni Student Recruitment</a> page on the AAUM site for more info. </p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example of a response from an actual student who had talked to an ASR rep: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>I wanted to thank you for taking the time to talk with me about the University of Michigan. </p>

<p>I enjoyed talking with you about your experiences on campus. It was clear to me that your passions for the Maize and Blue still run deep. After our conversation, as I drove home, I reflected on our discussion and really admire the excitement and dedication you have for your alma mater. </p>

<p>Further, after our discussion, it reinforced to me that the University of Michigan was the school for me. </p>

<p>When I read your email saying that you had checked in with Admissions and gave me a name (Delphine) to contact in order to ensure the school understood that Michigan was my top-choice school, I jumped at the chance. </p>

<p>I wrote her a mail this evening, and plan on following up to ensure that the school realizes how badly I want to be a Wolverine. </p>

<p>Thank you for the time you spent with me, for the motivation you gave me, and for the contact you provided me with. I greatly appreciate each of them, and am hoping to see you soon as a confirmed University of Michigan admitted student. </p>

<p>Go Blue! </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Couldn&#8217;t make up stuff like this if we tried! </p>
