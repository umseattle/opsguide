<p>This page is meant to be used by a board member when meeting with a prospective board member, to give them a brief overview of club operations. </p>

<p>This should generally follow some brief exchange of introductions, including U-M stories. </p>

<p>These are meant to be used as notes, not to be read verbatim by either current or prospective board members. </p>
<ul>
<li>Club Status 
<ul>
<li>The Club is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit registered in the state of Washington. </li>
<li>We are affiliated with, and supported by, the national Alumni Association. </li>
<li>The bulk of our club funding comes from the AAUM, which is in turn funded largely by membership dues. </li>
<li>All board members must be AAUM members. </li>
<li>The Seattle club is over 100 years old, and is the oldest U-M alumni club outside of the state of Michigan. </li>
<li>We are a very active and well-respected club within the Michigan network. </li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>Nature of the Board 
<ul>
<li>The club is run by an all-volunteer board of directors, aided by some subcommittees. </li>
<li>The board consists of 8 - 20 directors, including four officers: president, vp, secretary and treasurer. </li>
<li>Board members are generally elected at our annual meeting of members, generally held in May, but may be approved by the board throughout the year. </li>
