<p>We generally try to hold an event in July or August to congratulate and celebrate our incoming freshmen from the area, as well as their parents, and to give them a chance to connect with each other before heading off to Ann Arbor. We should coordinate with the Office of University Development for this event, since they sometimes host these, or can help find a local host. This is also an opportunity to let both students and parents know about our local club, as well as our club scholarship. </p>
