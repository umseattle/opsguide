<p>8.2 <a href="event-programming.html" class="nav-link">Event Programming</a>&#160;&#8593;</p><h5 id="event-procedure">8.2.1 Event Procedure</h5>
<p>Most of the value that our club delivers to our local Michigan alums comes in the form of events of one sort or another that we organize for them, so it&#8217;s worthwhile spending some energy to make sure each event is a success. </p>

<p>Following are the steps needed to plan and organize a successful club event. </p>

<h5 id="1-define-event-purpose-and-intended-audience">1. Define Event Purpose and Intended Audience</h5>

<p>Try to be clear-minded about why U-M alums might want to attend, and what sort of U-M alums would be interested. </p>

<h5 id="2-select-date-for-event">2. Select Date for Event</h5>

<p>This should generally be 60 - 90 days in the future for more complicated events, and 30 - 60 days in the future for simpler events, to allow adequate time for planning, coordination and communication. </p>

<p>Select a date and time that doesn&#8217;t conflict with other club events, and doesn&#8217;t conflict with other major events in the area. </p>

<p>Also consider seasonal factors. Plan outdoors events when the weather is likely to be good, and indoors events when the weather is likely to be less welcoming. </p>

<h5 id="3-select-venue-for-event">3. Select Venue for Event</h5>

<p>You may wish to consider some of the following questions when selecting a venue. </p>
<ul>
<li>Is it centrally located? </li>
<li>Is there a space where families with children can be seated? </li>
<li>Is parking available? How expensive is it? </li>
<li>Is it easily accessible via public transit? </li>
<li>Is the event area private and free of distractions? </li>
<li>Can the space accommodate the desired number of participants? </li>
<li>Does the establishment have access to the Big Ten Network (BTN)? </li>
<li>Is there space for a registration table, if one is needed? </li>
<li>What are the costs of food and beverage? </li>
<li>Is there audio/visual equipment available, if such equipment is needed? </li>
<li>What are costs, considering food and drink, etc.? Are there any minimums? Are they per event, or per hour? Are there any additional taxes, tips or fees that will be added on to the basic costs? </li>
</ul>

<h5 id="4-consider-a-sponsor-for-the-event">4. Consider a Sponsor for the Event</h5>

<p>Although a sponsor is optional, a local business may be willing to help defray some of the event costs in return for an opportunity to market itself to your participants. See the AAUM Sponsorship Guidelines on the Club Leader&#8217;s Site before selecting a sponsor. </p>

<h5 id="5-estimate-income-and-expenses-for-the-event">5. Estimate Income and Expenses for the Event</h5>

<p>Consider expenses such as facilities costs, food, beverages, etc. Consider income such as registration fees and possible sponsoring host. Consider possible discounts for AAUM members, and the amount needed to subsidize these discounts. </p>

<p>You may use the attached Budget Template to complete and total your estimates. </p>

<h5 id="6-submit-event-proposal">6. Submit Event Proposal</h5>

<p>Your proposal should include all or most of the following information. You may prepare your proposal by creating a new Event in the Planning Stage on our Website, or by simply including this information in an email that you send to the board.  </p>

<li><p>What: Enter a brief descriptive title for the event </p></li>

<li><p>Planned Attendance: Enter the number of expected attendees. </p></li>
<li><p>Discussion points: Highlight any questions or issues that merit further discussion by the board. </p></li>
</ul>

<h5 id="7-obtain-approval-for-event">7. Obtain Approval for Event</h5>

<p>The board should approve all club events before beginning any communications to members, or any financial commitments by the club. </p>

<p>The first step in holding a successful event is picking an event worth holding. None of the following guidelines are absolutes, but all are worth considering before deciding to hold an event. </p>

<h6 id="positive-factors-for-an-event">Positive Factors for an Event</h6>

<p>Here are some factors that bode well for a prospective event. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>A definite Michigan connection. We sometimes host events that have no particular Michigan connection, but those that feature a person or thing related to Michigan are particularly attractive to our members. </p></li>
<li><p>Events that provide an opportunity for alums to meet and interact with each other. </p></li>
<li><p>Events that one or more board members wish to attend. </p></li>
<li><p>Events with some element of novelty &#8211; something different that we haven&#8217;t done before, or haven&#8217;t done recently. </p></li>
<li><p>Repetition of a similar past event that proved to be successful, perhaps with some interesting variation. </p></li>
</ol>

<h6 id="negative-factors">Negative Factors</h6>

<p>On the other hand, here are some things to watch out for. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Events that put the club at some significant financial risk. In other words, if we have to front money for an event, and become dependent on having a certain number of alums attend in order to recoup our expenses, then this is less attractive than events where participants pay as they go, without any obligation on the club&#8217;s part to have some minimum number of alums attend. </p></li>
<li><p>Events without committed board attendance. If board members are all supportive of having an event, but no one on the board is actually excited enough about the event to actually attend, then this is generally a pretty good indication that turnout will be low.  </p></li>
</ol>

<h6 id="other-considerations">Other Considerations</h6>
<ol>
<li><p>It takes considerable time and effort to promote an event, so even if an event can be held for free, we may not want to invest the time to advertise it if it is likely to have little benefit for alums. </p></li>
<li><p>If we promote events that draw few attendees, then those that do show up may form a negative impression about our events, and may be discouraged from attending other events that we hold. </p></li>
<li><p>If we advertise events that are not attended by any board members, then attendees may feel that we have broken faith with them by asking them to attend an event that we ourselves do not feel is worth attending. </p></li>
<li><p>If we advertise events that are not attended by any board members, then we do not have any control over the quality of the experience, and we do not have a chance to obtain any direct feedback about the quality of the experience.  </p></li>
</ol>
