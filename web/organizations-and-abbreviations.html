<p>The AAUM is the primary source of funding for our club. As stated in our bylaws: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Club does not charge membership dues exclusive of AAUM. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As leaders of a regional club, we generally work supportively with all members of the greater University of Michigan community, including collaboration with development personnel from AAUM, U-M and from the individual schools within the University. </p>

<p>We also occasionally collaborate with the Michigan Ross Alumni Club of Seattle, which is yet another organization that is separate from our Club. </p>
